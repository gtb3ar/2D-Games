<h1>Simple 2D Games</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository contains two projects:

- A simple implementation of a classic <b>'Pong'</b> game
  <br /> A straight forward two player game akin to air hockey. Each player controls a paddle, and the ball is hit back and forth across the screen. The goal is to have the most points, to score a point, a player has to hit the ball in such a way that it circumvents past the other players paddle.

- A <b>Lunar Lander game</b> - (WIP) 
   <br /> A physics based game, where the player controls a spacecraft attempting to land on the surface of the moon. The player has to carefully manage thrust, and velocity to achieve a soft landing. Current features include:
  - Particle system
  - Splice generation
  - Vector projection

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>C++</b> 
  - SFML (Multi Media Library)
